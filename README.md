# NLW Cup Project

## **Class 01 - Starting an end-to-end project**

In this class we will prepare all the ends of our setup and start the code. Create our first HTTP route on the backend, prepare the project setup on the frontend and get started on Mobile with NativeBase.

## **Class 02 - Creating routes and accesses**

In this class we will focus on web development, build the database structure, structure the first routes and accesses to the database and connect the front and back-end.

## **Class 03 - Layout and mobile visual structure**

It's time for mobile. In this class we will build the layout using NativeBase to generate productivity and also prepare our application to receive the integration with the backend.

## **Class 04 - Connecting the mobile app to the API**

In this class we will finish building the backend and connecting the mobile app with our API. We are also going to implement social login and finally add the functionality to create and list pools.
